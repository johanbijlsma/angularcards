##What is AngularCards?
Angualrcards is an experiment to gain more experience with AngularJS. I've done some projects in the past with this Framework, but never did an Angular project by myself from start to finish.

###How can it be used?
By clicking the big CTA button "Start now", you will aksed a couple of questions. By clicking through these questions, you can set your preference for a "card". After copmleting all the steps of the form, your Card will be added to the other example cards on the page.
