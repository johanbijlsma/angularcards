##What is AngularCards?
Angualrcards is an experiment to gain more experience with AngularJS. I've done some projects in the past with this Framework, but never did an Angular project by myself from start to finish.

###How can it be used?
By clicking the big CTA button "Start now", you will asked a couple of questions. By clicking through these questions, you can set your preference for a "card". After completing all the steps of the form, your Card will be added to the other example cards on the page.

##Future additions
I'm not sure what to add next, but there will be things to add, such as sharing through social media; be able to change all the texts on a card; adding your own picture, or generate a page of cards with example news articles...
